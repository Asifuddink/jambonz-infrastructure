# jambonz infrastructure

This repository contains packer scripts for building AMIs and terraform scripts for creating full jambonz deployment architecture.  Since jambonz can be deployed in a variety of different-sized configurations there are several different subfolders.

- [jambonz-mini](./jambonz-mini): for building a single-server jambonz deployment, useful for development and testing.
